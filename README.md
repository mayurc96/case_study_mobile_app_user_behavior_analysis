"Order1" contains information about individual orders, including order quantities, prices, discounts, and more. "Order2" provides details about order dates and statuses. The analysis involves SQL queries to calculate the total order quantity, Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), and Net Sales. Additionally, it calculates similar metrics for orders placed in October 2022 with non-canceled statuses.
