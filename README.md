# case_study_mobile_app_user_behavior_analysis
In this case study, we delve into user behavior data from a mobile app, stored in tables "User1" and "User2." "User1" captures user installation data, such as country, platform, and first seen dates, while "User2" records user activity sessions. SQL queries are employed to address three key questions:

Calculate the 3-day, 7-day, and overall running sum of unique sessions per day, categorized by country and platform.
Determine the average number of days users use the app.
Calculate retention percentages for Day-1, Day-3, and Day-7, measuring user engagement over time.
This case study demonstrates how SQL can be applied to gain insights into user behavior, aiding app developers in understanding user engagement and retention patterns.
